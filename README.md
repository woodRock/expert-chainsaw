# Weather Forecast
![Weather](https://github.com/woodRock/expert-chainsaw/workflows/Weather/badge.svg)

This GitHub Action used the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to display a given area's weather forecasts. It updates every 30 minutes. The weather forecast is displayed within predefined tags (hidden inside HTML comments), such that it does not overwrite any other existing content in a README. This action may be novel for projects that are related too or rely on weather forecasting. Consider adding it to your workflow to work up a storm.
